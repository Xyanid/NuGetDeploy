1.4.5.3 - 2018.01.18 - wirblAxe
- changed logging to RollingMode.Date, and file name to date
- added some exception logging
- checks the BuildProject ExecuteCommands result for erros - as MsBuild redirects errors to stdOut - and ExecuteCommand seems to ignore Process.ExitCode
- checks if expected output file actually is created
